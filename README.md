# Hangman Project

## Description

* Project made with Python (3.8 in Nix Beta)
* Ran on Repl.it website--browser based code editor--as seen in screenshots (although not required to use this)

#### Quick Summary

This program runs the hangman game with **7** lives, where you guess the word letter by letter.

The game also provides you with important information as you play. Here are a list of examples:
* How many lives you have remaining
* The current word (what is guessed and what isn't)
* Shows all your previous guessed letters
* Informs you if you guessed the letter before
* Informs you if your guess not a letter (character not in alphabet, longer than 1 character, or no input)

**Initially** When first started, the program should look something like this:
